# Kunde-Website
Our website is named "Kunde"
There are several reasons behind this:
1. call to action
We want our visitors/users to develop healthy habits that they are able to reach anywhere and at any time yet in digital format. 
2. translation 
from kazakh lan. Kun - sun, Kunde - daily
Our intention is to make gender-neutral platform for the Earthlings by providing access worldwide 

From the name, we came to our logo. Bright and easy
